## Summary

The phrase refers to a small demo program, whose purpose is to send the message `"Hello, World!"`. It is often the simplest program one can write in a language, and for this reason is also the first program many will encounter. Though, this is not always true.[^1]

In spirit, the program demonstrates the syntax of a programming language. This idea is so universal it extends beyond programming langages.[^2]

## Examples
<small></small>
```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!")
```

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```rb
puts "Hello, World!"
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }	
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
