## Definition

The phrase refers to a small demo program whose goal is to send the message `"Hello, World!"`. It is often the simplest program one can write in a language, and for this reason is also the first program many will encounter.

[(For most languages, anyway.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Hello_World! "Brainfuck is a notable exception.")
</small>

## Purpose

A Hello World program showcases the minimum syntax necessary to get a working program. Its simplicity makes it ideal for demonstration, especially for people without coding experience.

[There are many analogs of this idea across different media.](https://www.ifwiki.org/Cloak_of_Darkness "In the Interactive Fiction community, this takes the form of "Cloak of Darkness"")
